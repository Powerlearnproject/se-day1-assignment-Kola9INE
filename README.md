#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

Software engineering is the application of engineering principles, methods and tools to the development and maintenance of high-quality software to solve problems. It is the process of defining the problem, designing a software solution in accordance to the user requirements (or user story), testing the solution in Minimal Viable Products (MVP) or Product Release Increments (PRI), maintaining the solution by removing or adding features and then deploying the solution for public use.


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

The milestones in the evolution of software engineering include the development of programming language (like C, Java, Fotran), the establishment of software engineering as a discipline in the 1960s, the advent of structural programming, object-oriented programming etc, the advent of Artificial Intelligence, the advent of cryptographies, cryptocurrencies and the rise of agile methodologies in the 2000s.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

ANSWER:
* REQUIREMENTS: This is the process where the user needs as well as system needs are understood and documented.
* DESIGN: This is the process of designing a high-level and graphical model to represent the software architecture.
* IMPLEMENTATION: This is the process of developing the codes accordint to user specifications.
* TESTING: This is the process where the developed product is tested to measure and confirm conformity to user specification.
* DEPLOYMENT: This is the process where the product is released to the user or deloyed for public use.
* MAINTENANCE: Based in reviews and feedbacks for users, certain modifications may be made to the product.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

ANSWER:
Waterfall approach to project follows the stages of intitialization, planning, execution, monitoring and controlling and closing. This approach is a rigid approach and discourages changes to the project requirements once it has begun. This approach is not feasible for projects that is expected to have series of changes whilst developing.
As compared to the Agile approach which was developed by technocrats to account for the rigidity of the waterfall appproach. The agile methodology is flexible and can accomodate changing requests form the product owners. It breaks a project into sprints which will be treated in iterations. This approach is typical and feasible for a software project where the product owners may suddenly have a feature he/she may want to add to his/her product.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

ANSWER:
SOFTWARE DEVELOPERS are the devlopers. They are the ones responsible for the development of a product by writing programs in the programming language of their choice.
QUALITY ASSURANCE ENGINEERS are the ones who ensure the product meets the requirements of the product owners, they check for bugs and reliability.
PROJECT MANAGERS are the ones who ensure the project runs smoothly form the beginning to the end.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

ANSWER:
* IDEs are tools or suites that permit a developer to write codes, test codes, etc on a device. Example includes the VSCode, Eclipse, Pycharm, IntelligIDE, etc.
* VCS are tools that allow developers to track changes to a source code and foster collaboration among other team members.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.

ANSWER:
* TIGHT DEADLINE: This is when the duration for the project is too short, thereby leading to burnout or a situation where the product does not meet ceetain requirements. This can be solved via properly engaging with the developers and the product owners.
* CHANGING REQUIREMENTS: This is when the requirements of the product is constantly modified, leading to a case of 'shifting the goal post'. This may lead to burnout on the team, lack of motivation or project delays.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

ANSWER:
UNIT TESTING: This is the process of testing the code in modules and unit.

INTEGRATION TESTING: This is the process of testing the compatibility and useability of the software with other softwares.

SYSTEM TESTING: This is the process of testing the code's compatibility with system platforms like Windows, Android etc.

ACCEPTANCE TESTING: This is the process of checking the conformity of the software with user requirements. This is carried out to align the product with the user's requirements.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

ANSWER: 
Prompt engineering is the process of structuring a query to enable a Generative AI produce a desired output in human readable language, image or video. Prompt engineering is as relevant as AI models themselves in that a good prompt engineering will make determine the output.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

ANSWER:

* A vague prompt would be:
User: What is software development?

* An improved prompt would be:
User: Explain software development as an experienced computer teacher to a fifth grade African student.

The improved prompt defines the role, the audience and context, providing the AI models with a clear direction of its expected output.
